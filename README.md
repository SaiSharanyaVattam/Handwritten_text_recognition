# Handwritten_text_recognition

Our project ‘Handwritten text recognition using deep learning’ aims at converting text written with hand into digital text by using Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which uses the architecture of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). The workflow of this system would be to extract the words from the image of a text using OpenCV and feed the words into a neural network model for the recognition of the words.
